# Pictoria AI - Personalized AI Photo Generation Platform

This code is my implementation of the project by CodeBucks.

Small bugs:

- [] Generating images when clicking tooltips
- [] No loading state on generation button
- [] Reloading screen and all images when deleting images
- [] Skeleton loaders needed for images
- [] Autoclose sidenav when pressing outside it

Additional features:

- [] Select and delete many images at once
- [] Video model training + generation
